**Reading about C isn’t enough. You should try writing one or two simple programs to see whether writing a program goes as smoothly as it looks in this chapter. A few suggestions follow, but you should also try to think up some problems yourself. You’ll find answers to selected programming exercises on the publisher’s website.**

1. Write a program that uses one  printf()  call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second  printf()  call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of  printf()  calls to print your first and last names on one line. 
The output should look like this (but using your name):
```
  Gustav Mahler ←First print statement
  Gustav        ←Second print statement
  Mahler        ←Still the second print statement
  Gustav Mahler ←Third and fourth print statements     
```

2. Write a program to print your name and address.

3. Write a program that converts your age in years to days and displays both values. At this point, don’t worry about fractional years and leap years.    

4. Write a program that produces the following output:
```
  For he's a jolly good fellow!
  For he's a jolly good fellow!
  For he's a jolly good fellow!
  Which nobody can deny!   
```
Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to  `main()` : one named `jolly()` that prints the “jolly good” message once, and one named `deny()` that prints the final line once. 

5. Write a program that produces the following output:
```
  Brazil, Russia, India, China
  India, China,
  Brazil, Russia   
```
 Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to  main() : one named `br()` that prints “Brazil, Russia” once, and one named `ic()` that prints “India, China” once. Let `main()` take care of any additional printing tasks.
